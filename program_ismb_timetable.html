            <p>Visualization and AI are increasingly intertwined. AI is being employed to enhance visualization design
                and to simplify interaction with data. Meanwhile, visualization can help people interpret and debug AI
                models, whether they are AI modelers or end users. Yet opportunities at the intersection of AI and
                visualization are in their infancy. This talk will explore the opportunity space in two directions:
                AI-for-VIS and VIS-for-AI, drawing on existing examples including my own research on natural language
                interaction, visualization recommendations, and medical applications.</p>

            <p> Cancer immunotherapies are revolutionizing clinical practice, yet only a fraction of patients derive
                clinical benefit, and some experience adverse events. To understand immune markers that impact
                clinical care, comprehensive data analyses across assay types and patient cohorts are being
                performed by NCI-supported Cancer Immune Monitoring and Analysis Centers (CIMACs) and Cancer
                Immunology Data Commons (CIDC). These represent 30+ cancer immunotherapy trials with longitudinal
                correlative data assayed using harmonized technology platforms. However, there is an unmet need for
                visual exploration of multi-scale multi-omic datasets. We introduce PRIMAVO, a unified platform that
                empowers users to visually explore, query, and subset the results of large-scale immune monitoring
                multi-omics datasets, spanning transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics, metagenomics, and multiplex
                immunohistochemistry (mIHC). Users can select specific clinical trials and patient subgroups based
                on key criteria including demographics, tumor, treatment, response and assay characteristics by
                leveraging interactive bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots. For user-specified subgroups,
                PRIMAVO offers tailored visualizations of their multi-assay datasets: CyTOF, Olink, serology and
                RNA-seq data are represented within interactive heatmaps with on-the-fly filtering, querying,
                sorting and clustering. From mIHC imaging data, user-selected cell subsets and multiple markers can
                be explored simultaneously. Interactive oncoprints visually summarize genomic mutations. Developed
                in direct collaboration with CIMAC-CIDC scientists and utilizing React, TypeScript, Python, and
                Django frameworks, PRIMAVO provides domain-specific, downloadable, resizable, zoomable, and
                scrollable charts and figures. Overall, PRIMAVO lowers barriers between complex immune monitoring
                data in immunotherapy trials and researchers by providing intuitive, fast, and high-quality access
                to longitudinal multi-scale multi-omics datasets, facilitating research capabilities. </p>

            <p> We introduce a novel hybrid system that combines a Mixed Reality (MR) stereoscopic view of 3D
                spatial data with linked views on a conventional 2D display. Our system addresses visualization
                challenges in spatial biology, focused on examining molecular components within a tissue’s native
                spatial context, resulting in complex and high-resolution 3D tissue maps. Given the diversity of
                techniques generating these maps, creating practical visualization tools is crucial. To tackle this,
                we collaborated closely with experts in spatial biology throughout the design process, conducting
                iterative development and testing through three case studies. The case studies include 1)
                single-cell cyclic immunofluorescence (CyCIF) imaging to investigate early melanoma development; 2)
                lightsheet microscopy of kidney tissue to understand the function of glomeruli, showcasing the
                insights gained into spatial relationships within kidney structures; and 3) multiplexed
                immunofluorescence imaging (MxIF) was used to study various structures in kidney tissue,
                highlighting the benefits of the hybrid approach in controlling channel information and conducting
                distance measurements. In extending the web-based Vitessce (http://vitessce.io) framework for
                single-cell analysis, a tool already familiar to domain experts, with a WebXR spatial view, we
                ensured usability and integration with existing workflows. A qualitative evaluation of our prototype
                demonstrated widespread recognition of the hybrid system's value, even among those initially
                skeptical of MR technology. Insights gathered from user feedback sessions strongly advocate for
                combining direct hand interaction in MR with traditional mouse input on a 2D display, highlighting
                the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing user experience and interaction with complex spatial
                data. </p>

            <p> Genomics experts use data visualization to extract and share insights from complex and large-scale
                data sets. The complexity of genomics data analysis, the diversity of users, and the scope of
                questions necessitate tools that support creating customized visualizations beyond off-the-shelf
                visualizations for exploratory analysis. Despite a good understanding of visualization use for
                genomics data exploration, research into these experts' specific authoring needs is limited.
                Previous work in visualization research has explored various interactive authoring techniques—such
                as template editing, shelf configuration, natural language input, and code editors—assessing their
                usefulness and the trade-offs between expressiveness and learnability, primarily for statistical
                visualizations. However, how genomics experts currently author visualizations and which techniques
                best meet their needs remains unclear. To bridge this gap in understanding, we conducted two
                connected user studies involving 33 genomics experts. The first consisted of semi-structured
                interviews (n=20) to understand current visualization authoring practices, followed by exploratory
                sessions with visual design probes (n=13) to gain insights about user intents and desired techniques
                beyond the currently supported. We identified key tasks, user characteristics, and current
                techniques used in tools, and discovered five personas to represent and discuss author diversity. By
                integrating insights from interviews and exploratory sessions, we further pinpointed task- and
                persona-specific patterns and used these to discuss design implications for genomics visualization
                tools. Our findings highlight the need for visualization tools supporting multiple authoring
                techniques to enhance both learnability and expressiveness, catering to the varied needs of users
                aiming to create highly customized genomics data visualizations. </p>

            <p> We introduce two new BioCyc visualization tools for exploring genomes, with the goal of accelerating
                science by helping users to rapidly navigate and understand complex biological systems.

                The Genome Explorer is an information-dense genome browser with high-speed semantic zooming. As
                magnification level increases, features such as promoters, transcription-factor binding sites, and
                nucleotide and amino-acid sequences become visible. By displaying such features inline, positional
                relationships are easy to discern visually, and the display can wrap across multiple lines to
                present a longer genome region in a single screen, providing greater genomic context. A comparative
                mode displays chromosomes from multiple organisms aligned at orthologous genes. The Genome Explorer
                includes the capability to select arbitrary sequence regions for export, and provides a tracks
                mechanism for depicting large-scale datasets against the genome.

                The Comparative Genome Dashboard summarizes and compares predicted functional capabilities across a
                selected set of organisms, utilizing a hierarchical framework of cellular function based on selected
                concepts from MetaCyc and GO. Users begin with a one-screen overview consisting of a set of panels
                for high-level functions such as Biosynthesis, Transport or Central Dogma, with individual plots for
                subsystems such as Carbohydrate Biosynthesis or DNA Metabolism. Each plot graphs either the numbers
                of relevant compounds predicted to be synthesized/degraded/transported based on pathway prediction
                algorithms or the numbers of genes annotated to that subsystem. Users can click on any plot for more
                detailed comparisons of specific synthesized/degraded/transported compounds or GO annotations, and
                thereby rapidly explore specific subsystems of interest.

            <p> Studying gene family evolution strongly benefits from insightful visualisations. However, the
                ever-growing number of sequenced genomes is leading to increasingly larger gene families, which
                challenges existing gene tree visualisations. Indeed, most of them present users with a dilemma: to
                display complete but intractable gene trees, or collapse subtrees, thereby hiding information.

                We developed Matreex, a new dynamic tool to scale-up the visualisation of gene families. Matreex’s
                key novelty is the use of “phylogenetic” profiles, i.e. condensed representation of gene
                repertoires, to minimize information losses when collapsing branches of the gene tree. Moreover, the
                gene tree is paired with a complementary interactive species tree which facilitates manipulation and
                exploration of large, heavily duplicated gene families.

                Matreex is user-friendly and provides an appealing and intuitive display which makes it ideal for
                creating easily interpretable figures for teaching and outreach. It can also be used to automate
                large-scale analyses of presence-absence of multiple gene families. For example, we used it to
                simultaneously display 22 gene families involved in intraflagellar transport across 622 species,
                cumulating 5,500 genes in a compact way. Doing this, we were able to report for the first time
                complete loss of the intraflagellar transport machinery in the myxozoan Thelohanellus kitaue.

                Matreex is available on the Python Package Index (pip install matreex), and source code and
                documentation are available at https://github.com/DessimozLab/matreex.

            <p> Nanopore sequencing measures ionic current during the translocation of DNA, RNA or protein molecules
                through a nanoscale protein pore. This raw current signal data can be ‘basecalled’ into sequence
                information and has the potential to identify other diverse molecular features, such as base
                modifications, secondary structures, etc. Despite the unique properties and potential utility of
                nanopore signal data, there are currently limited options available for signal data visualisation.
                To address this, we have developed Squigualiser, a toolkit for intuitive, interactive visualisation
                of sequence-aligned signal data, which currently supports both DNA and RNA sequencing data from
                Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) instruments. A series of methodological innovations enable
                efficient alignment of raw signal data to a reference genome/transcriptome with single-base
                resolution. Squigualiser generates an interactive signal browser view (HTML file), in which the user
                can navigate across a genome/transcriptome region and customise the display. Multiple independent
                reads are integrated into a signal ‘pileup’ format and different datasets can be displayed as
                parallel tracks to facilitate their comparison. Squigualiser provides the most sophisticated
                framework for nanopore signal data visualisation to date and will catalyse new advances in signal
                analysis. We provide Squigualiser as an open-source tool for the nanopore community:

                modern clustering techniques, several hundred to thousands of phenotypes can be detected.
                Additionally, each sample and phenotype can be associated with various metadata properties that are
                necessary for sense-making. As datasets grow, increasing the number of rows and columns in the
                heatmap can become overwhelming due to limitations in screen size and human perception. Fortunately,
                there is often redundancy within phenotypes and samples. For instance, two phenotypes that only
                differ by a single marker (e.g., a surface protein or gene) could be considered the same if that
                marker is immaterial. Similarly, two samples may be so alike that they could be combined without a
                noticeable difference in the emerging pattern. In other words, the data can often be aggregated. We
                introduce a visualization technique that supports displaying annotated heatmaps at different levels
                of detail. This framework provides support for constructing complex interactive collapsible heatmaps
                while allowing enough customization to support different use cases. </p>

            <p> How do cancer cells grow, divide, proliferate and die? How do drugs influence these processes? These
                are difficult questions that we can attempt to answer with a combination of time-series microscopy
                experiments, classification algorithms, and data visualization.
                However, collecting this type of data and applying algorithms to segment and track cells and
                construct lineages of proliferation is error-prone; and identifying the errors can be challenging
                since it often requires cross-checking multiple data types. Similarly, analyzing and communicating
                the results necessitates synthesizing different data types into a single narrative.
                State-of-the-art visualization methods for such data use independent line charts, tree diagrams, and
                images in separate views. However, this spatial separation requires the viewer of these charts to
                combine the relevant pieces of data in memory.
                To simplify this challenging task, we describe design principles for weaving cell images,
                time-series data, and tree data into a cohesive visualization. Our design principles are based on
                choosing a primary data type that drives the layout and integrates the other data types into that
                layout. We then introduce Aardvark, a system that uses these principles to implement novel
                visualization techniques. Based on Aardvark, we demonstrate the utility of each of these approaches
                for discovery, communication, and data debugging in a series of case studies. </p>

            <p> Effective visualization of current biomedical data from high-throughput technologies is essential
                for proper interpretability of complex biological processes but challenging due to its
                high-dimensionality, increasing volume and underlying biological complexity. This requires advanced
                dimensionality reduction methods (DRM) like t-SNE, UMAP, PHATE for optimal data reduction. However,
                different DRM may produce varied outputs, hindering consistent interpretation as well as making
                benchmarking challenging. Recently, we published MIBCOVIS, a Bayesian framework integrating five
                robust metrics with different features to enhance visualization and interpretability of
                high-dimensional data without relying on ground truth. We demonstrated that each visualization tool
                uniquely optimizes specific features and no tool was able to optimize all features jointly.
                Leveraging on this observation, we propose GIBOOST, a new visualization tool aimed at synergizing
                information from disparate sources for optimal data reduction and visualization. Given
                high-dimensional data, GIBOOST uses an optimized integrative autoencoder to integrate and select the
                two best data reduction methods from a pool of methods with the maximum additive clustering
                sensitivity effect condition on other visualization features. We apply GIBOOST to enhance the
                clustering separability of four distinct dynamic biological processes; EMT, Spermatogenesis, induced
                stem-cell pluripotency and placenta development. From all datasets, on average GIBOOST improved
                clustering sensitivity by 76% compared to the individual methods. </p>

            <p> Cis-acting mRNA elements play a key role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation
                efficiency. Revealing the interactions of these elements and their impact plays a crucial role in
                understanding the regulation of the mRNA translation process, which supports the development of
                mRNA-based medicine or vaccines. Deep neural networks (DNN) can learn complex cis-regulatory codes
                from RNA sequences. However, extracting these cis-regulatory codes efficiently from DNN remains a
                significant challenge. Here we propose a method based on our toolkit NeuronMotif and motif
                mutagenesis, which not only enables the discovery of diverse and high-quality motifs but also
                efficiently reveals motif interactions. By interpreting deep-learning models, we have discovered
                several crucial motifs that impact mRNA translation efficiency and stability, as well as some
                unknown motifs or motif syntax, offering novel insights for biologists. Furthermore, we note that it
                is challenging to enrich motif syntax in datasets composed of randomly generated sequences, and they
                may not contain sufficient biological signals. </p>

            <p>Biological data visualizations often deal with datasets resulting from complex analytical workflows or large-scale experiments. 
               These aspects complicate visual exploration, as insights are frequently found in the details. To surface these insights effectively, 
               BioVis software tools must address several key challenges: integrating closely with computation and data, being composable, scaling 
               to the task, and offering bi-directional interactions for AI/ML guidance.<br/><br/>

               Fortunately, software best-practices and new frameworks make it easier than ever to overcome these challenges. In this talk, Fritz 
               Lekschas will discuss these practices and frameworks using examples from his research in genomics and single-cell biology and the broader BioVis community.
